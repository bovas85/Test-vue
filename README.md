# The Process

## Sketching the app

I always try to visualize where the components will be in the Design, and make sure they make sense for the app and logic.

## App Skeleton

I always have a starter template which I created and updated every time I found some new and better ways to do things in code.

It contains improvements, performance tweaks and several components that I might need.

## Refining

Once that's in place, I make sure I only keep what's really needed and try to scrap the rest.

It won't be compiled, but it would pollute the repository.

## Git init

From here on, you can see the commits in the repo I will share via e-mail.
